### ABSTRACT:

Methods are provided for dynamically visualizing information in image data of an object of interest of a patient, which include an offline phase and an online phase. In the offline phase, first image data of the object of interest acquired with a contrast agent is obtained with an interventional device is present in the first image data. The first image data is used to generate a plurality of roadmaps of the object of interest. A plurality of reference locations of the device in the first image data is determined, wherein the plurality of reference locations correspond to the plurality of roadmaps. In the online phase, live image data of the object of interest acquired without a contrast agent is obtained with the device present in the live image data, and a roadmap is selected from the plurality of roadmaps. A location of the device in the live image data is determined. The reference location of the device corresponding to the selected roadmap and the location of the device in the live image data is used to transform the selected roadmap to generate a dynamic roadmap of the object of interest. A visual representation of the dynamic roadmap is overlaid on the live image data for display. In embodiments, the first image data of the offline phase covers different of phases of the cardiac cycle of the patient, and the plurality of roadmaps generated in the offline phase covers the different phases of the patient's cardiac cycle. Related systems and program storage devices are also described and claimed.
